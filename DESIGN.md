The design of Methuselah is supposed to be simplified, a "Sophomore homework assignment" if you will.

We got rid of the idea of parents. This was a major simplification. Instead we
use "sequence numbers" to put everything on a global "psuedo-timeline" within a
repository, ordering things by their sequence number.

In order to differentiate between revisions that were created at the same
sequence number but in different "places" or purposes, such that you can't
really compare them or merge them, we add the notiion of a "Series". This is
like a tome or story if you will. It has all the revisions gathered for a
particular purpose.
